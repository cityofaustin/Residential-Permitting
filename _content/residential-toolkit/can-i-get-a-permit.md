## When does my permit expire?

Permits have a 180-day lifespan from the day they are issued or from the most recent in-progress inspection. Permits open on the date they are issued and close on the day you pass your final inspection. Your permit will expire if your project hasn't been inspected or approved by day 181.

## I have open or expired permits

There are two ways to resolve open or expired permits.

### 1. Re-permit the project with a new permit application

This is the best option if the old project is impacted by the new project. For example, if you are working on the same structure but it now has an expired permit, you will need to get a new permit. It's important to let the reviewer know you intend to resolve the expired permit under the “project description” of the new permit application.

### 2. Get a separate inspection

You may still need a separate inspection even if your old project won’t be impacted by the new work. If the new project doesn't impact the old project, or you want a separate inspection, you need to fill out the following two forms and include them with your new application:

* [Request for a Permit Extension, Withdrawal, or Reactivation](/assets/applications-and-forms/Request_for_Permit_Extension__Withdrawal_or_Reactivation.pdf),
* And [Acknowledgement of Expired Permits](/assets/applications-and-forms/acknowlege_expired_permits.pdf) form.

Be sure to include the expired permit numbers and property address where necessary.

## What if I maxed out on impervious cover?

Building a deck or shed, or adding square footage to a current structure will increase your amount of impervious cover. If that sounds like your project, then you will need to schedule a free 20 minute in-person consultation to review your options. Reviewers may be able to help you adjust your plans so that you meet the impervious cover limits.

If your project will not increase impervious cover, then your permit will most likely be approved.
