It takes about 15 business days for your permit application to be reviewed once you submit it. There are two ways to check the status of your permit application:

* On [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index),
* Or by calling your reviewer.

## Check your permit status on Austin Build + Connect

You can check the status of your permit by visiting [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index). If you don't have an Austin Build + Connect account, you can create one on the Austin Build + Connect homepage. 

* Select “Conduct business with City,” and then follow the prompts for a first time user. 
* After creating your account, select “My Permits/Cases” from the navigation menu located on the left hand side of the screen.

You can then follow the prompts to check the status of your permit.

If your hired professional such as a general contractor submitted the permit application for you, then they will receive your approval or any comments. You can request for copies of any emails to be sent to you or have your authorized applicant forward them to you if this is the case.

## Call your reviewer

The third way to check the status of your permit is to call the reviewer who initially reviewed your permit application during the free 20-minute consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you haven’t applied for a permit yet, make sure you can get one. Close any open or expired permits you may have before moving forward with your project. To find out if you have an open or expired permit, click here to [learn if you can get a permit](/residential-toolkit/can-i-get-a-permit/).
