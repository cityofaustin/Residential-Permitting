Hold your place in line and save time.&nbsp;

Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can be an hour or longer. We recommend signing in to the&nbsp;[QLess website](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812), an online queueing system, or arriving as close to opening time as possible to sign up in person.

#### Instructions for signing up on the QLess website

Keep in mind you will only be able to sign in to QLess during the office hours of Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8am to 12pm.

* Select New Application if this is the first time you’re submitting your application. Select Update if you’re submitting an update to an existing application.
* You will get a text with your estimated wait time. Follow the text prompts to receive status updates, leave the line, or get help.
