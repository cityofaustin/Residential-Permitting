### Not all projects require a permit

Some types of projects can be completed without a permit. Examples of projects that don’t need a permit include:

* Fences not over 8 ft high or located in a flood hazard zone
* Sidewalks or driveways that aren’t located in a public right-of-way
* Painting, papering, tiling, carpeting, cabinets, counter tops, and similar work
* Prefabricated swimming pools less than 24 inches deep
* Playground equipment, including swings
* Portable heating and ventilation appliances or cooling units
* Other work as determined by the building official

You will probably need a permit if your project requires more work that what’s on this list. See a complete list of projects that don’t require permits in the Municode library section R105.2.
