### Not all projects require a permit

Some types of projects can be completed without a permit. Examples of projects that don’t need a permit include:

* fences not over 8 ft high or located in a flood hazard zone
* sidewalks or driveways that aren’t located in a public right-of-way
* painting, papering, tiling, carpeting, cabinets, counter tops, and similar work
* prefabricated swimming pools less than 24 inches deep
* playground equipment, including swings
* portable heating and ventilation appliances or cooling units
* other work as determined by the building official

You will probably need a permit if your project requires more work that what’s on this list. See a complete list of projects that don’t require permits in the Municode library section [R105.2](https://library.municode.com/tx/austin/codes/building_criteria_manual?nodeId=S6MILISAGU_6.4.0PEEXCORE).
