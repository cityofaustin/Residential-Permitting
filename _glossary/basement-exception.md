A basement may not need a permit if it: \* doesn't extend beyond the first floor's foundation, \* is mostly below ground level, \* and it does not rise more than 3 feet above the average elevation of the front yard setback.

A habitable portion of a building that is below grade may be exempted if the habitable portion does not extend beyond the first-story footprint and is below natural or finished grade, whichever is lower; and it is surrounded by natural grade for at least 50% of its perimeter wall area and the finished floor of the first story is not more than three feet above the average elevation at the intersections of the minimum front yard setback line and the side property lines.
