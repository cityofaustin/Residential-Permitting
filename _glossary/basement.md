A room that is below or partly below and partly above ground level. Can be habitable or used for storage.That portion of a building between floor and ceiling, which is below or partly below and partly above grade (see Grade), but so located that the vertical distance from grade to the floor below is less than the vertical distance from grade to ceiling. If the finished floor level directly above a basement is more than six feet above natural grade for more than 50 percent of the total perimeter, it is a story, not a basement.
