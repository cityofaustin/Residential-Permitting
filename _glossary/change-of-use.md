When used in reference to land use, means the replacement of an existing use with a new use, or a change in the nature of an existing use. A change of ownership, tenancy, name, or management, or a change in product or service within the same use classification where the previous nature of the use, line of business, or other function is substantially unchanged is not a change of use.
