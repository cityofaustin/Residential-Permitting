The City of Austin defines fence in two ways: \* a decorative fence is made of up 25% or less solid material and uses an open design \* a solid fence is built with more than 25% solid material

**Requirements:** A fence can't be built in a floodplain. Contact the Watershed Protection Department to determine if there is floodplain on your property. Visit http://www.austintexas.gov/email/floodpro or call 512-974-2843 and leave a message.

An ornamental fence has no additional requirements or height restrictions. A solid fence over 7 feet in height requires a consultation with a reviewer at the Service Center and authorization from any neighboring property owners that are affected by the fence. There are no requirements or restrictions on the types of materials you can use to build a fence.

(A) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a fence: (1) is permitted as an accessory use in any zoning district; and (2) must comply with the requirements of this section. (B) In this section: (1) an ornamental fence is a fence with an open design that has a ratio of solid material to open space of not more than one to four; and (2) a solid fence is a fence other than an ornamental fence. (C) The height restrictions of this section do not apply to an ornamental fence. (D) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a solid fence constructed along a property line may not exceed an average height of six feet or a maximum height of seven feet. (E) A solid fence along a property line may be constructed to a maximum height of eight feet if each owner of property that adjoins a section of the fence that exceeds a height of six feet files a written consent to the construction of the fence with the building official, and: (1) there is a change in grade of at least two feet within 50 feet of the boundary between adjoining properties; or (2) a structure, including a telephone junction box, exists that is reasonably likely to enable a child to climb over a six foot fence and gain access to a hazardous situation, including a swimming pool. (F) A solid fence may be constructed to a maximum of eight feet in height if the fence is located on or within the building setback lines. (G) a solid fence may be constructed to a height of eight feet if the fence is located between a residential use and: (1) property zoned as a commercial or industrial base district; (2) property used for a commercial or industrial use; or (3) an alley that separates a residential use and: (a) property zoned as a commercial or industrial base district; or (b) property used for a commercial or industrial use.
