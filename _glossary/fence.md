  The City of Austin defines two fence types:
  * an **ornamental fence** is made of up 25% or less solid material, featuring an open design

  A fence of any kind cannot be built in a floodplain. Contact the Watershed Protection Department to determine if there is floodplain on your property.

  An ornamental fence has no additional requirements or height restrictions.

  A solid fence over 7 feet in height requires consultation with a reviewer at the Service Center and authorization from neighboring property owners, if they are affected by the fence.

  There are no requirements or restrictions on the types of materials used to construct a fence.

  >Depending on its placement on your property, the grade of your land, and the types of properties that neighbor your own, a solid fence may have additional requirements. Bring a survey of your property and an outline of the project to the Service Center to receive additional guidance.
