Low land made up of silt or sand on the edge of a river or creek that floods when the body of water overflows and water rushes from the banks.

You can find out if your home is in a floodplain by visiting [austintexas.gov/floodpro](http://austintexas.gov/floodpro/). Enter your address and if your Flood Zone says, “Flood Zone: X,” then you DO NOT live in a floodplain.
