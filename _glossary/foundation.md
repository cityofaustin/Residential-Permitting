The load-bearing part of a building, usually ground-level unless there is a basement.
The interface between a building and the supporting soil. Foundations provide support for vertical gravity loads from the weight of a building and its contents, provide resistance to horizontal sliding, and must resist vertical loads at the ends of braced walls.
