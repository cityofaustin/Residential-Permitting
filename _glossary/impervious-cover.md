Impervious cover is any type of man-made or stone surface that doesnâ€™t absorb rainfall.

Surfaces such as stone, rooftops, patios, driveways, sidewalks, roadways, parking lots, and some decks are considered impervious cover. Uncovered wooden decks count as 50% impervious cover.

Impervious cover does not include sidewalks or easements in the public right-of-way, water features such as ponds, pools, fountains, and non-compacted areas with gravel used only by pedestrians.

Dependent on zoning designation, a certain percentage of impervious cover is permitted on a property. [Download this spreadsheet](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Residential/Calculation_aid.xls)&nbsp;to assist you with calculating impervious cover.
