All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/residential/resources/contact/#residential-plan-review).&nbsp;

Reviewers provide free 20 minute in-person consultations for residents who want help with general questions about their project. Even though you can’t submit your permit application to a reviewer, having a consultation saves time and helps make the permitting process easier.

For more specific issues regarding your project, consider scheduling a [paid consultation](/residential/resources/applications-and-forms/residential-review-consultation-form).&nbsp;

## How can I prepare for my consultation?

We suggest preparing some information about your property and project ahead of time to share with the reviewer during your consultation. This information allows the reviewer to tell you what permits you’ll need to finish your project. Follow these steps to make the most of your consultation.

### 1. Be prepared to answer these questions about your project:

* What is the address of the property you are working on?
* Will you move or demolish any interior or exterior walls?
* Will you need to replace or change your roof?
* Will you add to or remove any square footage from your home or property?
* Will you increase your home’s square footage by fifty percent or more?
* Will you demolish or change any existing property features such as a patio, a driveway, or a walkway?
* Will you change or add electrical wiring, plumbing, or a heating and cooling system?
* Will you make any cosmetic changes that would require an express permit?
* Do you have any trees larger than 19 inches in diameter on your property?
* Is your home more than 40 years old?

The [project scoping worksheet](/residential/resources/applications-and-forms/project-scoping-worksheet) can help you collect this information. You can also bring the worksheet to your consultation to help save time.

### 2. If possible, bring your property survey

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like: [setbacks](/residential/resources/glossary/setback), [easements](/residential/resources/glossary/easement), and [impervious cover](/residential/resources/glossary/impervious-cover).

#### What if I don't have my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* home lender or title company from your original purchase,
* neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* or, a surveyor to get a new survey.

You can find a surveyor through the [Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov).

### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your property or home interior

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine if you can continue with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches of the floor plan and plot plan to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can see the following:

* the current layout of your property including any existing structures such as your house, pool, or driveway,
* and the layout of the structure you may be changing, adding, or removing.

Do your best to label any load-bearing walls or beams.
