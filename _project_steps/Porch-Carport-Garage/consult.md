All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/residential/resources/contact/#residential-plan-review).

Reviewers provide free 20 minute in-person consultations for residents who want help with general questions about their project. Even though you can’t submit your permit application to a reviewer, having a consultation saves time and helps make the permitting process easier.

For more specific issues regarding your project, consider scheduling a [paid consultation](/residential/resources/applications-and-forms/residential-review-consultation-form).

## How can I prepare for my consultation?

We suggest preparing some information about your project ahead of time to share with the reviewer during your consultation. This information allows the reviewer to tell you what permits you’ll need to finish your project. Follow these steps to make the most out of your consultation.

### 1. Be prepared to answer these questions about your project:

* What is the address where your conversion will take place?
* Is the conversion:
  * attached to your home?
  * is the existing space a porch, carport or garage?
  * is the water heater accessed from this area?
  * will any portion of the converted space be used as a bedroom?
  * covered or uncovered?
  * going to need plumbing?

The [project scoping worksheet](/residential/resources/applications-and-forms/project-scoping-worksheet) can help you collect this information. You can also bring the worksheet to your consultation to help save time.

### 2. If possible, bring your property survey.

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like: [setbacks](/residential/resources/glossary/setback), [easements](/residential/resources/glossary/easement), and [impervious cover](/residential/resources/glossary/impervious-cover).

#### What if I don't have my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* or, your surveyor to get a new survey.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov/education/).

### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of the converted space.

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine if you can continue with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches of the floor plan and plot plan to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to be perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can see the following:
