All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/resources/contact/#residential-plan-review).

Reviewers provide free 20 minute in-person consultations for residents who want help with general questions about their project. Even though you can’t submit your permit application during your consultation, meeting with a reviewer will save you time and help make the permitting process clearer and easier.

## How can I prepare for my consultation?

We suggest preparing some information about your shed ahead of time to share with the reviewer during your consultation. This information allows the reviewer to tell you what permits you’ll need to finish your project. Follow these steps to make the most out of your consultation.

### 1. Be prepared to answer these questions about your project:

* What is the address where you will build the deck?
* Is your deck:
  * Attached to your home?
  * Accessible by a door?
  * Smaller than 200 square feet?
  * Built in a floodplain?
  * 30 inches or more above ground?
  * Covered or uncovered?
  * Going to need electricity?
  * Near a tree greater than 19 inches in diameter?

The project scoping worksheet can help you collect this information. You can also bring the worksheet to your consultation to help save time.

### 2. If possible, bring your property survey.

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like: [setbacks](/resources/glossary/setback), [easements](/resources/glossary/easement), and [impervious cover](/resources/glossary/impervious-cover).

#### What if I don't have my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, your surveyor to get a new survey.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov/education/).

### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your deck and property.

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine if you can continue with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches of the floor plan and plot plan to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can see the following:

#### Where will the deck be on your property?

Sketch the layout of your property and show any existing structures including your home, pool, shed, driveway, etc. If possible, include estimated square footage or dimensions of the items on your property.

#### What will your deck look like?

Sketch the deck you will build and include its dimensions. Be sure to show it in relation to your home, where it will attach to your home (if it will), and any doors that will open onto the deck.
