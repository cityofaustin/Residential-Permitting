      1. Make sure you have your IVR personal identification number (PIN). To
      get an IVR PIN, complete the form [Inspection Agent Letter of
      Authorization and Request for IVR PIN Number]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/assets/applications-and-forms/ivr-agent-authorization.pdf). You can
      also pick up a form at the Inspections Office on the third floor of One
      Texas Center, 505 Barton Springs Road, or request a form by calling (512)
      978-4000. Upon completion, submit the form to the Inspections Office and a
      PIN number will be assigned upon submittal.

      2. Call the IVR number: (512) 480-0623.   

      3. Choose among (1) Schedule Inspections (see requirements below); (2)
      Obtains status on inspections, or (3) Cancel the Inspection. If a building
      permit has been issued, it is subject to a #100 (Pre-Construction) and
      #101 (Building Lay-Out) inspection. This will be displayed on the permit
      printout. If a standalone electrical, mechanical, or plumbing (trade)
      permit has been issued, it is subject to a rough and final inspection.
      Permits and approved plans must be on site at the time of the inspection.
      Inspections for Trade permits cannot be scheduled until the building
      permit has been issued, all fees have been paid, and required inspections
      (Pre-Construction and Building Layout) have been performed.   

      4. Enter your IVR PIN.

      5. Enter your ten-digit permit number.

      6. Enter the three-digit inspection code. [Click here to View Inspection
      Type
      Codes](http://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Development_Services/Inspection_Types.pdf).
      Note: Inspections are usually performed within 24 hours after scheduling,
      but an inspector's workload can delay a scheduled inspection until the
      next business day or 48 hours after scheduling. If you have a question
      about your inspection, you may contact your inspector. [Click here for a
      list of inspectors' names and contact
      information](http://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Building_Inspection/staff_contacts.pdf).
      Calls to an inspector may not be answered immediately because they are
      conducting an inspection, or driving. Please leave a voicemail with your
      name, phone number and address, and they will contact you.
