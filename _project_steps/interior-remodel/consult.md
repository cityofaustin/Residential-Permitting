All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/resources/contact/#residential-plan-review).

Reviewers provide free 20 minute in-person consultations for residents who want help with general questions about their project. Even though you can’t submit your permit application during your consultation, meeting with a reviewer will save you time and help make the permitting process clearer and easier.

## How can I prepare for my consultation?

We suggest preparing some information about your shed ahead of time to share with the reviewer during your consultation. This information allows the reviewer to tell you what permits you’ll need to finish your project. Follow these steps to make the most out of your consultation.

### 1. Be prepared to answer the following questions about your project:

* Are you moving any interior walls?
* Are you adding to or removing any square footage from your home?
* Does your property have any [trees larger than 19 inches in diameter](/residential-toolkit/building-near-a-tree/)?
* Are you demolishing any walls?
* Are you changing or adding electrical wiring, plumbing, or a heating and cooling system?
* Is your home more than 40 years old?

The project scoping worksheet can help you collect this information. You can also bring the worksheet to your consultation to help save time.

### 2. If possible, bring your property survey.

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like: [setbacks](/resources/glossary/setback), [easements](/resources/glossary/easement), and [impervious cover](/resources/glossary/impervious-cover).

#### What if I don't have my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, your surveyor to get a new survey.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov/education/).

### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your property or home interior.

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine if you can continue with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches of the floor plan and plot plan to your consultation. Use a separate page for each sketch. These sketches don’t have to be perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can see:

#### What your interior currently looks like, including any windows and doors.

* The current floor plan
* The existing walls of your home
* Any walls you will tear down

#### What your remodel project will look like when it's completed.

* The proposed floor plan (including new windows or doors)
* The proposed new walls

Make sure you label smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and any walls that will be partially or completely torn down. Do your best to label any load-bearing walls or beams.
