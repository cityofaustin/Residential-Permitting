You need to provide a paper application and some additional documents when you apply for a permit. The types of documents you need to submit with your application depend on the kind of project you want to build. A reviewer can help you find out what documents you need if you come in for a free 20 minute consultation. &nbsp;You can also [hire a professional](/residential-toolkit/hiring-a-professional) to help you apply for your permit.

## What happens at Residential Plan Review?

A &nbsp;staff member will meet with you and use a checklist called a Gold Sheet to perform a completeness check.

Once you apply, you will be moved into the Review process. Reviewers will either approve your application or send you any required changes in the form of comments. This process typically takes about 15 business days.

## What documents will I need?

All shed permit applications require:

### 1. Application

The [new construction/addition application]({{ site.url }}/assets/applications-and-forms/new_con_addtn_app_AWU.pdf) is the application you need to fill out for a shed. This application can be filled out by either you or your architect, engineer, expeditor, or other licensed professional.

### 2. Plot plan

The plot plan must be drawn to scale by hand or on a computer. It can be prepared by you or a licensed professional. Use graph paper if you're drawing your plot plan by hand to make it easier to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.

> You can draw your shed to scale on a copy of your survey. It’s easier and helpful for reviewers!

{% include diagram.html diagram="plot-plan" %}

### 3. Floor plan

The shed’s floor plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on a computer and can be prepared by you or a hired professional. If possible, use graph paper to make drawing to scale easy for you. We highly suggest you draw your floor plan on 3 pages for clarity. If the reviewers can’t understand your drawings, your project will be rejected.

Use a separate page for each of the following items:

* Existing walls and features to be demolished,
* Existing walls and features that will remain,
* Your proposed floor plan.

{% include diagram.html diagram="floor-plan" %}

### 4. Elevation plan

The elevation plan of your proposed addition or extension must be drawn to scale either by hand or by using a CAD program and can be prepared by you or a hired professional. Again, use graph paper if you’re hand drawing the elevation plan. See [examples](/resources/sample-plans).

{% include diagram.html diagram="elevation" %}

### 5. Foundation plan or Structural Verification Report

The foundation plan can only be drawn by a structural engineer. A foundation plan is required for all custom-built sheds. A foundation plan is also required for any foundations that require digging into the ground (excavating) or building a level surface (grading), such as a pier and beam foundation or a slab foundation. You will need a foundation plan if you put a prefabricated shed on a slab foundation.

For prefabricated sheds that require a building permit, a copy of the plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report]({{ site.url }}/assets/applications-and-forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted instead of a foundation plan.

### 6. BSPA form

When applying for a shed building permit, a signed [BSPA Form]({{ site.url }}/assets/applications-and-forms/bspa.pdf) from [Austin Energy](/resources/contact/#austin-energy) is required to confirm your shed isn't too close to any power lines.

### Other commonly required documents

* [**Owner’s Authorization Form**]({{ site.url }}/assets/applications-and-forms/coaownersletter-1.pdf) An engineer, architect, or any other licensed professional will need your permission to submit your application. Use this form if they will submit your application for you.
* **Wind Bracing and Framing Plan:** If your shed will be over 500 square feet and custom built, you will need wind bracing and framing plans that are drawn to IRC standards by you, a structural engineer, an architect, or a certified building designer.

* Sign up for intake in person at the QLess Kiosk. The kiosk is located within the Residential Plan Review Division.
