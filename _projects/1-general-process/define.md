## Why does the city require permits?

Whether you change the layout of your home or add a new addition, most home improvement projects require a permit from the city. Permits are needed to make sure any changes or additions are structurally sound, safe, and follow zoning regulations.

### Not all cosmetic work requires a permit

There are certain home improvement projects that can be completed without a permit. You don’t need a permit or an inspection if you only:

* Replace or switch out finishes or fixtures like flooring, tile, countertops, cabinets, painting walls, light fixtures, toilets or sinks,
* Remove less than 32 square feet of sheetrock,
* Or add non-metal roofing materials like shingles.

You will probably need a permit if your project requires more work that what’s on this list.

## Can I get a permit?

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure your project doesn’t have any future code issues. Zoning regulations usually apply to exterior projects and exist for the safety of you and your family, guests, and neighbors. Zoning regulations are also kept in place to ensure that Austin’s beauty is protected for many generations.

### The most common zoning regulations are:

* [Setbacks](/resources/glossary/setback)
* [Easements](/resources/glossary/easement)
* [Impervious Cover](/resources/glossary/impervious-cover)
* [Floodplains](/resources/glossary/floodplain)
* And historic reviews for homes over 40 years old.

## Who can apply for a permit?

You can apply for a permit without the help of a licensed professional if you are starting a small project such as building a fence or making other small changes.

### You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on your project’s specific plans, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect, or surveyor to complete certain parts of the application. If you’re building a new home or building onto your existing home, you will most likely need to hire a licensed professional. The reviewer will tell you which application materials will need to be filled out by a licensed professional during your consultation.

### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work. It’s important that you hire a licensed contractor who will make sure this work is done properly. [Check out our tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

## Common types of permits

### Building permits

Building permits are issued when you plan to construct, enlarge, demolish, improve, move, or repair a structure within the City’s zoning area. Many major home improvement projects require a building permit unless the changes are cosmetic and will not affect the original construction of your home.

### Trade permits

Trade permits are required if your project will include changes to electrical wiring, plumbing, or heating and cooling. Trade permits are needed because the work is specialized.

You will need a trade permit if your project includes:

* Adding or moving an electrical outlet or fixture,
* Installing HVAC,
* Moving or adding a plumbing utility,
* Or installing a new hot water heater.

Your contractor is responsible for getting the required permits if you are installing or replacing a hot water heater.

### Tree permits

Having certain trees on your property may require a tree permit.

Measure the diameters of any trees on your property. You can calculate the diameter of a tree by taking a measurement of the trunk at 4.5 feet from the ground. Not all trees grow straight up from the ground. Some grow on a slope, others lean to one side, and some branch out near the ground. If that sounds like one of your trees, [use this diagram to measure your tree](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/City_Arborist/Tree_Measurement_Diagram.pdf).

If any of your trees measure 19 inches or more in diameter, they are protected and require a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](/assets/applications-and-forms/tree_permit.pdf) before you start construction. You will also need to pay an additional fee.

You will not be able to remove trees that are 19 inches or more in diameter and also considered heritage trees.&nbsp;[Learn more about protected trees and construction requirements](/residential-toolkit/building-near-a-tree/).

### Demolition permits

Demolition permits are necessary if you change any walls in your home, extend a room past your home’s current footprint, or add any windows or doors. If you apply for a demolition permit, you will need:

* A survey or plot plan (you can use the same one used for your interior remodel or new addition application).
* To have it signed by the owner and notarized.
* Photographs of the area to be demolished. We recommend taking photos from several angles and taking more than you may think necessary.

### Express permits

You can apply for an express permit if you are making small changes to your home that don’t require moving plumbing fixtures, like converting a bathtub to shower or vice-versa. Applying for an express permit will help make sure these changes are done safely. [Figure out if your project qualifies for an express permit](/residential-toolkit/express-permits).

### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a project starts at $200 and goes up depending on your project’s specific needs. This cost includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

There will be additional charges if your project requires a trade permit, like an electrical or plumbing permit, if you are building near a tree, or if your home is in a historic neighborhood. Your reviewer can explain those costs during your in-person consultation.

### Make sure you can get a permit

You may not be able to get a new permit right away if your property currently has an open or expired permit. You may also be unable to get a permit if you've already reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage on your property. If this happens, reconsider your materials or design.

## You may need a consultation to determine your project requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20 minute consultation with one of our reviewers before applying for their permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you the personalized property information you need to fill out your application. Depending on the information you learn during your consultation, you may not be able to complete your project as you originally planned.
* Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
* Explain the next steps needed to apply for a permit.
