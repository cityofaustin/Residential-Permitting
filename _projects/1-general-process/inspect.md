---


Inspections are required as you build your permitted project and when you're finished with the project. Inspections make sure all of your work is safe and that your project will last a long time.

---

## What inspections will I need?

A list of the required inspections for your project will be printed on the back of the permit you receive.

---

## Who can schedule inspections?

Anyone associated with the permit can schedule an inspection: the general contractor, the homeowner (if listed as the general contractor on the permit), the trade contractor, or other official agents.

---

## How do I schedule my inspections?

Inspections can be scheduled one of two ways.

### Online

* In order to schedule your inspections through the [Austin Build + Connect portal](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index), you must be a registered user. If youâ€™re not already registered, you can register online.
* Click on "My Inspections" in the Menu option and follow the prompts.
* If you are experiencing difficulty, you can call 512-978-4000 between the hours of 7:45am and 4:45pm, or e-mail DSD Help at [dsdhelp@austintexas.gov](mailto:dsdhelp@austintexas.gov)

### In-person

In person at [Building Inspections](/resources/contact/#building-inspections) at One Texas Center.


### Do I need to be home for my inspection?

You will find out whether or not you need to be home when you schedule your inspection.

If you don't need to be home during your inspection, you must clearly post your permitted plans and your permit for your inspector.

---

## What happens during inspection?

The inspector will inspect your work based on the approved building plans and their checklists. They will identify any needed improvements.

* [Framing checklist](/assets/applications-and-forms/Residential_Inspection_Checklist_Framing.pdf).
* [Foundation checklist](/assets/applications-and-forms/Residential_Inspection_Checklist_Foundation.pdf).
* [Layout checklist](/assets/applications-and-forms/Residential_Inspection_Checklist_Layout.pdf).

Your inspector is a great source of information and can answer questions about meeting building and safety requirements.

## Final inspection

Your project is complete once you pass your Final Inspection. The inspector will email you your Certificate of Occupancy either while they are on your property or when they return to their office. This will close your permit and mark it as complete in city records.

It is important to close your permit(s). If you don't, it may prevent you or future homeowners from receiving permits on your property. Learn more about [open and expired permits](/residential-toolkit/can-i-get-a-permit/).

### What if I don't pass my final inspection?

The inspector will let you know why you did not pass. You may not have passed your inspection because:

* You didn't do everything you needed to do in order to pass, like following the reviewer's comments,
* Or you did something that was not included in the plans.

You must make any needed changes and reschedule your final inspection before your permit expires.

Permits are only valid for 180 days. However, each time you get an inspection and work is done on the project, your permit is extended an additional 180 days.

If the required changes are taking longer than 180 days to make, you may need to extend your permit in person at the [Service Center](/resources/contact/#service-center) at the One Texas Center. This requires that you fill out a Permit Extension/withdrawal/activation form. This type of extension is only permitted once.

Remember, you must pass your final inspection in order to close your permit(s).
