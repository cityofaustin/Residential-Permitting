### 2. Plot Plan

The deck's plot plan must be drawn to scale by hand or on a computer. It can be prepared by you or a licensed professional. Use graph paper if you're drawing your plot plan by hand to make it easier to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.

### 3. Floor Plan

The deck's floor plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on a computer. The floor plan can be prepared by you or a licensed professional. If possible, use graph paper to make it easier to draw to scale. Include details such as any support beams and handrails on the floor plan.
