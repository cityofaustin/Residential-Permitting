      **What is a setback?**

















      The space between a lot's border and the area where a building can be
      built. Setbacks typically cannot have anything built on them.

















      Regardless of how tall your deck is, you can't build it within 10 feet of
      the rear border or within 5 feet of the side borders of your lot.

  - tab_title: Easements
    tab_content_markdown: >-
      **What is an easement?**

















      An area of a resident's property that can be used, built on or changed by
      a government entity or neighbor. You may not build on any easements on your
      property.

















      The city will need to access any easements on your lot. You may be fined or
      asked to demolish your deck if you choose to build it on an easement.

















      [Learn more about easements](/resources/glossary/easements).
  - tab_title: Impervious Cover
    tab_content_markdown: >-
      **What is imperious cover?**

















      Rooftops, driveways, parking lots, and other man-made or stone surfaces
      that keep water from being absorbed into the ground.

















      Impervious cover restrictions are put in place to prevent flooding during
      and after heavy rains. If your deck is uncovered, has spaces between the
      planks, and is located over a permeable surface like grass, then only half
      of the deck’s surface area will affect the total amount of impervious cover
      on your property. If you are covering your deck or there won’t be spaces
      between the planks, then 100% of the deck’s surface area will count towards
      the amount of impervious cover on your property. A reviewer can help you
      change your deck design if you max out your impervious cover.

Before you start building your deck or apply for a permit(s), it’s important to describe what your project is, figure out if you need any permits, and collect the information you need for your consultation and application. You can start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

## What is a deck?

A deck is a platform-like structure without walls, often made of planks, that no one will be living on and is typically used for lounging or gathering.

[If this doesn't sound like your project, check out the General Process page](/projects/general-process).

---

## Requirements for all decks

Whether your project needs a permit or not, there are still zoning regulations you must follow to make sure your deck follows the City of Austin’s code. You can find out if you need a permit after you make sure your deck doesn't break any of the code regulations described below.

## Do I need a permit?

### Building Permits

Your deck requires a building permit if it will be or have any of the following:

* Be attached to your home,
* Be over 200 square feet (more than 20 feet x 10 feet),
* Be more than 30 inches above ground,
* Have plumbing,
* Have electric,
* Or be built in a floodplain. To find out if you're in a floodplain, enter your address at [austintexas.gov/floodpro](http://austintexas.gov/floodpro/). If your Flood Zone says “Flood Zone: X,” then you do not live in a floodplain.

### Electric Permits

Having electricity on your deck requires getting an electric permit.

* If you want to run a line of electricity to your deck for an outlet or fan, you will need to get a stand-alone electric permit in person from the&nbsp;[Service Center](/contact/#service-contact) at One Texas Center.
* Only a registered electrician can get a permit if the electricity on your deck requires making changes to the main electrical meter.
* If your deck requires a building permit, the City will automatically include the electric permit with your building permit.

### Tree Permits

Measure the diameters of any trees on your property. You can calculate the diameter of a tree by taking a measurement of the trunk at 4.5 feet from the ground. Not all trees grow straight up from the ground. Some grow on a slope, others lean to one side, and some branch out near the ground. If these sound like one of your trees, [use this diagram to](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/City_Arborist/Tree_Measurement_Diagram.pdf)&nbsp;help you take an accurate measurement.

Any trees that measure 19 inches or more in diameter are protected and require getting a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/tree_permit.pdf) before you start construction. You will also need to pay an additional fee.

You will not be able to remove trees that are 19 inches or more in diameter and also considered heritage trees.

Learn more about [protected trees and their construction requirements](/residential-toolkit/building-near-a-tree/).

### Water Permits

Having plumbing on your deck requires getting an electric permit.

## Getting a building permit

Getting a permit proves that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code.” Building permits guarantee that any changes you make are safe for you, guests, and neighbors. You will follow the same process for submitting a permit application for covered or uncovered decks.

### How much do building permits cost?

Building permits for decks start at $584.48 and go up depending on the your specific needs. This cost includes the plan review, the actual permit, inspections, and any additional fees.

There will be additional fees if your project requires a trade permit like an electrical or plumbing permit, or if you are building near a tree. Your reviewer will explain any additional costs during your consultation.

### Make sure you can get a permit

You may not be able to get a new permit right away if your property currently has an [open or expired permit](/residential-toolkit/can-i-get-a-permit/). You may also be unable to get a permit if you have already reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage on your property. If this happens, reconsider your deck materials or design.

## You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specific plans for your deck, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect or surveyor to help you complete certain parts of the application.

You can find out which parts of your application may need to be prepared by a licensed professional by reading the Apply section or by asking the reviewer during a consultation.

### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work. They are responsible for getting any necessary permits as long as they have your written authorization. If you want to hire a contractor, make sure they have a license and can get the project done properly.

## You may need a consultation to determine your deck requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20 minute consultation with a reviewer before applying for a permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you personalized property information that will help you fill out your application. Depending on what you learn during your consultation, you may not be able to build your deck as you originally planned.
* Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
* Explain the steps you need to follow to apply for a deck permit.
