## What is the review process?

### 1. Approval or comments

Reviewers will look through your application and check your plans for compliance against both the [IRC (International Residential Code)](https://www.iccsafe.org/codes-tech-support/codes/2015-i-codes/irc/) and the [LDC (Land Development Code)](https://www.municode.com/library/tx/austin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT25LADE). They will either approve your application or attach comments in a Master Comment Report. This process takes about 15 business days.

You can check the status of your permit application on [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index). To check your permit status, create an Austin Build + Connect account and select “My Permits/Cases” from the left side menu.

You can search for expired permits by selecting "Public Search," and then entering the property address, date range, or permit case/type and clicking submit.&nbsp;

If you are not the applicant, meaning a hired professional submitted your application, the hired professional will receive the approval of your permit application or any review comments. You can request to be sent copies of any emails or have your authorized applicant forward them to you.

### 2. If you receive comments, your plans must be adjusted

Comments are sent in a Master Comment Report to the email provided on the application.

If you need help understanding your comments, reference the [Municipal Code](https://www.municode.com/library/tx/austin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=THCOAUTE01) and [glossary](/residential-toolkit/glossary/) or speak with a professional.

If you have questions or concerns about your comments, you can reach out directly to the reviewer associated with the specific comments. This information can be found on your comment document.

### 3. Submit updated plans

You can resubmit plans by following the same process as your initial [application submission](http://alpha.webuildthis.city/projects/deck#how-do-i-submit-my-application?).

After you or your hired professional resubmit, you will either receive notice that your plans have been approved or you will receive new comments. If you receive comments a second time, there is an additional $355.68 fee for a third round of review.

### 4. Repeat if needed

This process will be repeated until all comments are addressed and your application is approved.

Most applications go through 2 rounds of review. After a second round of review, additional reviews incur a fee of $355.68.

## What happens after my application is approved?

When your application is approved, you or your hired professional will receive an email notification stating that your permit and approved plans are ready to be picked up at the Service Center at One Texas Center. Your permit must be posted somewhere visible on your work site before you begin your project.

Remember, permitting doesn’t stop when you start building. Your work must be inspected throughout your process. Your permit will be closed after the final inspection.
