title: 'Apply for an Interior Remodel Permit in Austin, Texas'
step_number: 3
project_name: interior remodel
---


You will need to provide both the paper application and some additional documents when you apply for a permit. The documents you need to submit with your application will depend on the type of interior remodel you want to do.

Anyone applying for a permit can meet with one of our reviewers for a free 20 minute in-person consultation. During the consultation, the reviewer will tell you which additional documents you need for your project. You will not be able to submit your application to the reviewer at your consultation.

## What documents will I need?

### 1. Application

The interior remodel application can be filled out by you, an architect, or an engineer.

You'll need a demolition application if you are tearing down walls, or will need to change any windows or doors. The demolition application can be filled out by either you or a licensed professional.

### 2. Plot Plan

The plot plan must be drawn to scale by hand or on a computer. It can be prepared by you or a licensed professional. Use graph paper if you're drawing your plot plan by hand to make it easier to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.

### 3. Floor Plan

The floor plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on a computer. The floor plan can be prepared by you or a licensed professional. If possible, use graph paper to make it easier to draw to scale. We strongly recommend drawing your floor plan on 3 pages to help reviewers understand your drawings. If the reviewers can’t understand the drawings, your project will be rejected.

Use a separate page for:

* Existing walls and features that will be demolished
* Existing walls and features that will remain intact
* Your proposed floor plan.

### 4. Elevation Plan

You don't need an elevation plan for an interior remodel.&nbsp;

### 5. Structural Drawings

You'll need structural drawings if you are removing a load-bearing wall or changing any structural components. Structural drawings refer to any bracing, framing or structural verification reports and should be completed by a licensed Texas engineer or architect.

### 6. Foundation Plan

Your foundation plan must be drawn by a structural engineer.

### Other commonly requested documents

* **Owner’s Authorization Form**: This form is only required if you are not signing the application. An engineer, architect, or any other hired professional will need your permission to submit your application. Use this form if they will submit your application for you.
* **Certified Tax Certificate or Warranty Deed**: You need to pay any taxes you owe before your permit is approved.
* **Austin Water Utility Form**: This form is required if you are adding bathrooms or doing any work that will promote you to the next water meter size. An example of this can be increasing from 3 to 3.5 bathrooms.
* **Homeowners Authorization Letter**: There is a space for a homeowner’s signature on the application. You can choose to sign there instead of submitting a letter.
* **S.M.A.R.T. Housing Project Information**: You were probably told if your home was part of the S.M.A.R.T. Housing initiative when you purchased it. If you participate in S.M.A.R.T. housing, you will need to include both a signed certification letter from Neighborhood Housing and Community Development (NHCD) and a signed conditional approval letter from Austin Energy Green Building.&nbsp;
* **Demolition Application**: This application is only necessary if you change any walls in your home, extend a room past your home's current footprint, or add any windows or doors. If you need a demolition application, you will also need:
  * A survey or plot plan that is signed by the owner and notarized (you can use the same plot plan as your interior remodel or new addition application).
  * Pictures of the area to be demolished. We recommend taking photos from several angles and taking more than you may think necessary.

## How do I submit my application?

Intake happens during&nbsp;[Residential Plan Review](/resources/contact/#residential-plan-review) at the One Texas Center. You may:

* Sign up for intake in person at the QLess Kiosk. The kiosk is located within the Residential Plan Review Division.
* You can also save time by joining the line remotely on the [QLess website](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812).
  * Fill out your name and phone number on the website and select Residential-Permit Application Submittals.
  * Select New Application if this is the first time you’re submitting your application. Select Update if you’re submitting an update to an existing application.
  * You will get a text with your estimated wait time. Follow the text prompts to receive status updates, leave the line, or get help.

### What happens at intake?

During intake, a staff member will meet with you and use a checklist to perform a completeness check.

Remember to leave enough time for the completeness check. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can be an hour or longer. We recommend signing up online or arriving as close to opening time as possible and sign up in person.

Once you apply, you will be moved into the Review process. Reviewers will either approve your application or send you any required changes in the form of comments. This process typically takes about 15 business days.
