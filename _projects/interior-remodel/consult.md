title: 'Get a Consultation for an Interior Remodel in Austin, Texas'
step_number: 2
project_name: interior remodel
---


All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/resources/contact/#residential-plan-review) located at One Texas Center.

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation with your reviewer, we suggest preparing some information about your property and project ahead of time. This information allows the reviewer to tell you what permits you'll need to finish your project. Sharing information with your reviewer before you apply for a permit will save time.

Remember that you can't officially submit your permit application to the reviewer during the consultation. Having a consultation saves time and helps make the permitting process easier.

## What do I need to bring?

### 1. Collect the following information:

* Are you moving any interior walls?
* Are you adding to or removing any square footage from your home?
* Does your property have any [trees larger than 19 inches in diameter](/residential-toolkit/building-near-a-tree/)?
* Are you demolishing any walls?
* Are you changing or adding electrical wiring, plumbing, or a heating and cooling system?
* Is your home more than 40 years old?

### 2. Fill out the property and profile cards.

Fill out the project and property profile cards as much as you can and bring them to your consultation. Your reviewer will help you complete the cards and can answer any questions you have. Filling out these cards will help you save time and make the most of your 20 minute consultation.

### 3. If possible, bring your property survey.

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like: [setbacks](/resources/glossary/setback), [easements](/resources/glossary/easement), and [impervious cover](/resources/glossary/impervious-cover).

#### What if I don't have my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, your surveyor to get a new survey.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov/education/).

### 4. Draw a few simple sketches of your property or home interior.

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine if you can continue with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches of the floor plan and plot plan to your consultation. Use a separate page for each sketch. These sketches don’t have to be perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can see:

* The current floor plan
* The proposed floor plan (including new windows or doors)
* The existing walls of your home
* The proposed new walls
* Any walls you will tear down

#### Sketch 1
What your interior currently looks like, including any windows and doors.

#### Sketch 2: 
What your remodel project will look like when it's completed.

Make sure you label smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and any walls that will be partially or completely torn down. It’s very important that you label any load-bearing walls or beams.
