title: 'Define your Interior Remodel in Austin, Texas'
step_number: 1
project_name: interior remodel
---


Before you start your interior remodel or apply for a permit(s), it’s important to describe what your project is, figure out if you need any permits, and collect the information you need for your consultation and application. You can start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

## What is an interior remodel?

An interior remodel fixes or updates the appearance or use of an existing home without adding or removing square footage.

[If this doesn't sound like your project, check out the General Process page](/projects/general-process).

---

## Do I need a permit?

Your project will need specific permits depending on what you want to do. You may need an express permit, an interior remodel permit, a new addition permit, or no permit at all. You may also need to apply for a trade permit if you will change or install electric, plumbing, or HVAC.

If you can simplify your project enough, you may be able to change your project plan so that you don't need a permit. You can change your project plan before you apply as long as it still meets the requirements for a simpler permit.

### Not all cosmetic work requires a permit

There are certain home improvement projects that can be completed without a permit. You don’t need a permit or an inspection if you will:

* Replace finishes or fixtures such as flooring, tile, countertops, cabinets, painting walls, light fixtures, toilets or sinks,
* Remove or repair less than 32 square feet of drywall,
* Or add non-metal roofing like shingles.

### Express permits

Small changes, like converting a bathtub to shower or vice-versa, that don't require moving plumbing fixtures in your home are eligible for express permits. Applying for an express permit will help make sure it’s done safely.&nbsp;[Figure out if your project qualifies for an express permit](/residential-toolkit/express-permits/).

### Interior remodel permits

With the exception of changing doors and windows, an interior remodel only affects the inside of your home. You will need to apply for an interior remodel permit if your project includes at least one of the following:

* Moving electric or plumbing fixture locations,
* Moving an interior wall,
* Changing an exterior wall, such as adding a window or door, or changing the size of a window.

Examples of projects that qualify for an interior remodel permit include:

* Kitchen remodels,
* Bathroom remodels,
  * Removing more drywall than what surrounds the bathtub or shower in bathrooms,
* Adding a window or door where one did not originally exist,
* Or making a window bigger.

Your interior remodel may need a demolition permit, especially if you will move or change an interior wall, or change a window's shape. Extra considerations are taken if you make a change to your home's load-bearing walls or supports.

### New addition permits

While you may think your project is a remodel, the City of Austin may considered it as a new addition.

A new addition permit is required if you change your home's footprint by expanding a room, or if you convert a garage into a living or sleeping space. Other examples include:

* Adding square footage to your home, (air conditioned or un air conditioned)&nbsp;
* Converting inhabitable space into habitable space,
* Or moving an exterior wall.

You may need a demolition permit if you tear down an exterior wall.&nbsp;

If this sounds like your project, [schedule a consultation](/projects/interior-remodel/consult/) to review any zoning considerations that will affect your project.

### Trade permits

You will need trade permits if your project involves changes to electrical wiring, plumbing, or your home's heating and cooling system. Trade permits are required for this type of specialized work.

You will need a trade permit if your project includes:

* Adding or moving an electrical outlet or fixture,
* Installing HVAC,
* Moving or adding a plumbing utility,
* Or installing a new hot water heater.

Your contractor is responsible for getting the required permits if you install or replace your hot water heater.

### Tree permits

Having certain trees on your property may require a tree permit.

You will need to have your project reviewed by a city arborist if you have any trees over 19 inches in diameter on you property. Even though there aren't any trees inside your home, arborists make sure the tree's Critical Root Zone isn't damaged by any construction equipment brought in to remodel your home.&nbsp;[Learn more about protected trees and their construction requirements](/residential-toolkit/building-near-a-tree/).

## Getting a permit

### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting an interior remodeling project starts at $200 and goes up depending on your project's specific needs. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

There will be additional charges if your project requires a trade permit, like an electrical or plumbing permit, if you are building near a tree, or if your home is in a historic neighborhood. Your reviewer can explain the costs during your in-person consultation.

### Make sure you can get a permit

You may not be able to get a new permit right away if your property currently has an [open or expired permit](/residential-toolkit/can-i-get-a-permit/). You may also be unable to get a permit if you have already reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage on your property. If this happens, reconsider your interior remodel materials or design.

## You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specific plans for your interior remodel, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect or surveyor to help you complete certain parts of the application.

You can find out which parts of your application may need to be prepared by a licensed professional by reading the Apply section or by asking the reviewer during a consultation.

### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work. They are responsible for getting any necessary permits as long as they have your written authorization. If you want to hire a contractor, make sure they have a license and can get the project done properly.&nbsp;[Check out our tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

## You may need a consultation to determine your project requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20 minute consultation with a reviewer before applying for a permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you personalized property information that will help you fill out your application. Depending on what you learn during your consultation, you may not be able to build your deck as you originally planned.

* Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
