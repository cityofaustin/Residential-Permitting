## Define
{: .step}

Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize some information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure that is physically detached from your house that no one will be living in and will be used for storage.

### Requirements for all sheds

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure there are no future code issues with your shed. One way to ensure you won’t have code issues is to purchase a pre-made shed that is less than 200 square feet (less than 20 ft x 10 ft) that you can move if you need to.

---

#### Setbacks

If your shed will be more than 15 ft tall, you may not build within 5 ft of the side border of your lot or within 10 ft of the rear border of your lot. If your shed will be less than 15 ft tall, then you may not build within 5 ft from both the side and rear borders of your lot.
{: .insert-glossary-here}

#### Easements

When there is an easement on your lot and you choose to build on the easement, you run the risk of future fines or possible demolishment of your shed if the city needs to access your easement.
{: .insert-glossary-here}

#### Impervious cover

Typically, your impervious cover cannot exceed 40% of your property. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding.

### Do I need a permit?

#### Building permits

Your shed requires a building permit if it will:

* Be over 1 story
* Be over 200 square feet (over 20 ft x 10 ft)
* Be built in a floodplain
* Have plumbing
* Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC)

#### Electric permits

Having electricity in your shed does not require a building permit, however you must still get an electricity permit from the Service Center on the first floor of the One Texas Center.

* If your shed won’t otherwise require a building permit, this is known as a stand-alone electricity permit
* If the electricity in your shed will require changes to the main electrical meter, a registered electrician must get the permit (also known as a trade permit)

#### Tree permits

If your shed will require you to remove a tree (or perform construction within the critical root zone) that when measured 4.5 ft from the ground (diameter at breast height or DBH) is 19 in or more in diameter (59.6904 in around), then you will need a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/tree_permit.pdf). If your tree is 19 in or more in diameter and a heritage tree, then you may not be able to remove it.

Learn more about protected trees [INTERNAL LINK: Can I remove that tree?] and constructions requirements.

### Yes, I need a building permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code”, so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors.

#### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property has any [open or expired permits](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/) or is at its max impervious coverage, you may not be able to get a permit right away.

#### You may need a consultation to determine your  shed requirements

While it is possible to prepare your application [INTERNAL LINK: Prepare shed tab] without consultation, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before preparing to apply. At a consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Speak to the specific requirements of your project such as your: easements, setbacks, and impervious cover; whether or not your property is in a floodplain; historic review; and zoning. Be aware that based on this information, you may find in consultation that you cannot build your shed as planned.
* Provide you with a list of the documents you will need to prepare for your application based on your project
* And explain the next steps in your process

#### You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specifics of your shed, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an architect, engineer, or surveyor to complete some required application materials.

Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a professional in the Apply section [internal anchor link].

##### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work and should be getting any needed permits themselves. However, you want to make sure that you select a licensed contractor that will see that this is done properly.

Check out the City of Austin’s [tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a shed starts at $584.48, if your shed will be less than 1750 square feet in size. This includes the plan review, the permit, and fees.

If you will be building near a protected tree, need a trade permit, or will be building a shed greater than 1750 square feet, then there will be additional charges.

### Make the most out of your consultation

Consultation is not where you submit your application. However, in order to make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, it’s helpful to prepare some information about your property and your proposed project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet [Downloadable PDF].

#### 1. Collect the following information

* What is the address of where will you be building your shed?
* What will you be using this shed for?
* Will your shed:
  * Be over 1 story?
  * Be over 200 square feet (over 20 ft x 10 ft)?
  * Be built in a floodplain?
  * Have plumbing?
  * Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC)?
  * Have electricity?

#### 2. Draw a few simple sketches of your shed and property

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two simple sketches to your consultation.

##### a. Where your shed will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property with any existing structures (such as your house, pool, driveway, deck, etc.) and your shed. Including the estimated dimensions or square footage of these structures would also be helpful.

See Examples

| Good Example | Bad Example |

##### b. What your shed will look like

Sketch your proposed shed with its dimensions and any windows or doors.

See Examples

| Good Example | Bad Example |

#### 3. Bring your Property Survey if possible

While your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

* Your setbacks: ensuring you don’t build in your setbacks will prevent future complications with the placement of your shed.
* Your easements: like setbacks, considering easements in the placement of your shed will prevent future issues.
* Your impervious cover: impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding.

##### What if I can’t find my survey?

You likely received your survey when you purchased your home, if you purchased your home after 1980. If you didn’t or if you can’t locate it, try checking with your:

* Local property records or engineering department
* Local tax assessor or tax collector
* Home lender or title company from your original purchase
* Or, try asking your neighbors where they got theirs

Remember, you survey is not required for consultation.

Once you apply, you will be in the Review process [Internal link to Review: Shed section], and the reviewers will have 21 days from the day your application goes into the system to send you required changes in the form of comments.

## Review

After submitting your application, you enter into the review process. During review, you and the city work together to make sure your plans are:

* Up to code
* Safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors
* And sustainable

### What is the review process?

#### 1. A set of reviewers will have 21 days to look through your application and either approve it or attach comments

You can check the status of your permit application on [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/login?reset=true&amp;t_loginAgain=1). To check your permit status, you must create an Austin Build + Connect account and select “My Permits/Cases” from the left side menu.

Note that if you are not the applicant, meaning a hired professional submitted your application, the hired professional will be receiving your approval or any comments. You can request sent a copy of any emails if this is the case.

#### 2. If you receive comments, your plans must be adjusted

Comments are sent in a word document via email.

If you need help understanding your comments, reference the Municipal Code [External Link to code] and [glossary](/resources/glossary/).

If you have questions or concerns about your comments, you can reach out to the reviewer associated with the specific comments directly. This information will be located on your comment document.

#### 3. Submit updated plans

Resubmission is done through the same process as your initial application submission [Internal link to How do I submit my application?]

After you or your hired professional resubmit, you will receive either notice that your plans have been approved or you will receive new comments.

#### 4. This process will be repeated until all comments have been addressed and your application is approved

Most applications go through 2 rounds of review.

### What happens after my application is approved?

When your application is approved, you or your hired professional will receive an email notification stating that your permit and approved plans are ready to be picked up at the [Service Center](/contact/) at One Texas Center. Your permit must be posted somewhere visible on your work site, and then you may begin your project!

Remember, permitting doesn’t stop when you get started. Your work must be inspected throughout your process and when you’re finished in order to close any permits.

## Inspect

Inspections are required throughout your permitted project and when you’re finished to make sure all of your work is safe and sustainable.

### What inspections will I need?

When you receive your permit, a list of the required inspections for your project will be printed on the back of your permit.

### Who can schedule inspections?

Anyone associated with the permit can schedule an inspection: the general contractor, the homeowner (if listed as the general contractor on the permit), the trade contractor, or their official agents.

### How do I schedule my inspections?

Inspections can be scheduled one of three ways. [tab set]

### Do I need to be home for my inspection?

When you schedule your inspection, you will find out whether or not you need to be home. &nbsp;

If you are not required to be home during your inspection, you must clearly post your permitted plans and your permit for your inspector.

### What happens during inspection?

Your inspector will inspect your work based on the approved building plans and their checklists and identify any needed improvements.

* Framing checklist
* Foundation checklist
* Layout checklist

Your inspector is a great source of information to answer questions about meeting your requirements and building your shed safely and sustainably.

### Final Inspection

Your project is complete once you pass your Final Inspection. Your inspector will email you your Certificate of Occupancy either from their device while they are on your property or when they return to their office. This will close your permit marking your permit as complete in city records.

It is important to close your permit(s) because if you do not, it may prevent you or future homeowners from receiving permits on your property in the future. Learn more about [open and expired permits](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/).

#### What if I fail my final inspection?

Your reviewer will let you know why you did not pass. You must make any needed changes and reschedule your final inspection before your permit expires. Since permits are only valid for 180 days, you may need to extend your building permit to make the required changes before it expires. This can be done at the [Service Center](/contact/) at the One Texas Center.

Remember, you must pass your final inspection in order to close your permit(s).
