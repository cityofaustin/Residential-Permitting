## What documents will I need?

All shed building permit applications require:

### 1. Application

The [new construction/addition application](/assets/applications-and-forms/new_con_addtn_app_AWU.pdf) is the application you need to fill out for a shed. This application can be filled out by either you or your architect, engineer, expeditor, or other licensed professional.

### 2. Plot plan

The plot plan must be drawn to scale by hand or on a computer. It can be prepared by you or a hired professional. Use graph paper if you're drawing your plot plan by hand to make it easier to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.

> Note that for a shed, you can draw your shed to scale on a copy of your survey. It’s easier and helpful for reviewers!

[SR to include shed-plot-plan]

### 3. Floor plan or Structural Verification Report

The floor plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on a computer. The floor plan can be prepared by you or a hired professional. If possible, use graph paper to make it easier to draw to scale.

For prefabricated sheds that require a building permit, a copy of the plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](/assets/applications-and-forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted in place of a floor plan.

### 4. Elevation plan

The elevation plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer. The elevation plan can be prepared by you or a hired professional. For prefabricated sheds, plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](/assets/applications-and-forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted instead of an elevation plan.

[SR to include shed-elevation-plan]

### 5. Foundation plan

The foundation plan can only be drawn by a structural engineer. A foundation plan is required for all custom-built sheds. A foundation plan is also required for any types of foundations that require digging into the ground (excavating) or building a level surface (grading), such as a pier and beam foundation or a slab foundation. If you will be putting a prefabricated shed on a slab foundation, you will need a foundation plan.

### 6. BSPA form

When applying for a building permit for a shed, a signed [BSPA Form](/assets/applications-and-forms/bspa.pdf) from [Austin Energy](/contact/#austin-energy) is required to confirm your shed isn't too close to any power lines.

### Other commonly required documents

* [**Owner’s Authorization Form**](/assets/applications-and-forms/coaownersletter-1.pdf) An engineer, architect, or any other hired professional will need your permission to submit your application. Use this form if they will submit your application for you.
* **Wind Bracing and Framing Plan:** If your shed will be over 500 square feet and custom built, you will need a wind bracing and framing plan that's drawn to IRC standards by you, a structural engineer, an architect, or a certified building designer. If you choose to draw this plan yourself, you will need to have a structural engineer complete a [Structural Verification Report](/assets/applications-and-forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf).

## How do I submit my application?

Intake happens during Residential Plan Review at the One Texas Center. You may:

* Sign up for intake in person at the QLess Kiosk. The kiosk is located within the Residential Plan Review Division.
* You can also save time by joining the line remotely on the QLess website.

  * Fill out your name and phone number on the website and select Residential-Permit Application Submittals.

  * Select New Application if this is the first time you’re submitting your application. Select Update if you’re submitting an update to an existing application.

  * You will get a text with your estimated wait time. Follow the text prompts to receive status updates, leave the line, or get help.

### What happens at intake?

During intake, a staff member will meet with you and use a checklist to perform a completeness check.

Remember to leave enough time for the completeness check. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can be an hour or longer. We recommend signing up online or arriving as close to opening time as possible and sign up in person.

Once you apply, you will be moved into the Review process. Reviewers will either approve your application or send you any required changes in the form of comments. This process typically takes about 15 business days.
