tabs:
  - tab_title: Setbacks
    tab_content_markdown: "**What is a setback?** The space between a lot's border and the area where a building can be built. Setbacks typically cannot have anything built on them. If your shed will be less than 15 feet tall, then you must keep 5 feet from both your side and rear property lines clear. You may not build within these spaces. If you shed will be more than 15 feet tall, then you must keep 10 feet from your rear property line clear and 5 feet from your side property line clear, and you may not build within these spaces. There is also a 25 foot setback from your front property line. [Learn more about setbacks](/resources/glossary/setback)."
  - tab_title: Easements
    tab_content_markdown: '**What is an easement?**An area of a resident’s property that can be used, built on or changed by a government entity or neighbor. You may not build on any easements on your property. The city will need to access any easements on your lot. You may be fined or asked to demolish your deck if you choose to build it on an easement[Learn more about easements](/resources/glossary/easement).'
  - tab_title: Impervious Cover
    tab_content_markdown: '**What is impervious cover?** Rooftops, driveways, parking lots, and other man-made or stone surfaces that keep water from being absorbed into the ground. If you do not live in a floodplain, your impervious cover cannot exceed 45% of your property. If you do live in a floodplain, your impervious cover cannot exceed 10% of your property. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to make sure a significant amount of water is making it back into the soil and to prevent flooding.

Getting a permit proves that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code.” Building permits guarantee that any changes you make are safe for you, guests, and neighbors. Before you start building your shed or apply for permits, it’s important to:

* define and describe your project,
* find out if you need &nbsp;permits (hyperlink to projects that don’t require a permit) and what they are,
* collect the right information for your consultation and application.

You can start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

## What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure no one lives in that is physically detached from your house and is used primarily for storage.

Projects that have the same requirements as a shed include: greenhouses, workshops, garages or carports, gazebos, and playhouses.

[If this doesn't sound like your project, check out the General Process page](/projects/general-process).&nbsp;

## Zoning requirements

Whether your project needs a permit or not, there are still zoning regulations you must follow to make sure your shed follows the City of Austin’s code. Some customers choose to buy pre-made sheds since they can be moved off of easements and setbacks. Pre-made sheds still count towards your total impervious cover and must also follow zoning requirements. &nbsp;

## Do I need a permit?

### Building permits

Your shed requires a building permit if it will:

* Be over one story,
* Be over 200 square feet,
* Have plumbing,
* Be over 15ft tall,
* Be attached to your house,
* Or be built in a floodplain. To find out if you're in a floodplain, use your address at [austintexas.gov/floodpro](http://austintexas.gov/floodpro/). If your Flood Zone says “Flood Zone: X,” then you do not live in a floodplain.

#### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a shed starts at $584.48, if your shed will be less than 1750 square feet in size. This cost includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and additional fees.

There are additional fees if you build near a protected tree, need a trade permit, or build a shed greater than 1750 square feet.

#### Do prefabricated sheds require a permit?

A prefabricated shed may still require a permit. To see if your prefabricated shed requires a permit, refer to “Do I need a permit?” You do not need a permit to build or pour a foundation (such as pier and beam or concrete slab) for a prefabricated shed that otherwise doesn’t need a building permit.

### Electric permits

Having electricity in your shed requires an electric permit.&nbsp;

* Make sure to tell your reviewer your shed needs an electric permit and circle it on your application.&nbsp;
* If you want to run a line of electricity to your shed for a light or outlet, you will need to get a stand-alone electric permit in person from the [Service Center](/resources/contact/#service-center) at One Texas Center.
* Only a registered electrician can get a permit if the electricity on your shed requires making changes to the main electrical meter.

### Tree permits

Having certain trees on your property may require a tree permit.

Measure the diameters of any trees on your property. You can calculate the diameter of a tree by taking a measurement of the trunk at 4.5 feet from the ground. Not all trees grow straight up from the ground. Some grow on a slope, others lean to one side, and some branch out near the ground. If that sounds like one of your trees, [use this diagram to measure your tree](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/City_Arborist/Tree_Measurement_Diagram.pdf).

If any of your trees measure 19 inches or more in diameter, they are protected and require a [Tree Ordinance Review Application]({{ site.url }}/assets/applications-and-forms/tree_permit.pdf) before you start construction. You will also need to pay an additional fee.

You will not be able to remove trees that are 19 inches or more in diameter and also considered heritage trees.&nbsp;[Learn more about protected trees and construction requirements](/residential-toolkit/building-near-a-tree/).

### Make sure you can get a permit

You may not be able to get a new permit right away if your property currently has an expired permit. Use the public search at Austin Build + Connect to check for expired permits.

You may also be unable to get a permit if you have already reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage on your property. If this happens, reconsider your shed materials or design.

## &nbsp;

## You may need a consultation to determine your shed requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20 minute consultation with a reviewer before applying for a permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

Give you personalized property information that will help you fill out your application. Depending on what you learn during your consultation, you may not be able to build your shed as you originally planned.

* Answer any application questions.
* Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
* Explain the steps you need to follow to apply for a permit.

You may need to hire a licensed professional to help you complete your project.
